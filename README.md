The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive, multi-phase database application engineered to support the full lifecycle of book circulation within a multi-branch library network. Built in **Spring 2025** as part of **CSE 3330: Database Systems** at **The University of Texas at Arlington**, this academic project models real-world library logistics through schema design, data management, and user interaction.

This project was executed across **three development phases**:

- **Phase 1:** ER modeling and relational schema creation
- **Phase 2:** Data loading and query development
- **Phase 3:** Frontend integration via a Python-based Tkinter GUI

The system is centered on managing:

- 📚 **Book and copy availability** across multiple branches
- 👤 **Borrower account management**
- 📖 **Loan and return transactions**
- 💰 **Late fee calculations and record-keeping**

It emphasizes practical experience in:

- 📐 Designing **normalized relational schemas** with primary/foreign key constraints
- 💾 Writing and optimizing **SQL queries** to retrieve and update book/loan data
- 🖥️ Building a **Python GUI (Tkinter)** to interact with the backend database
- 📊 Importing structured datasets for books, authors, borrowers, and branches
- 🧠 Enforcing data integrity and validation in real-time

The user interface allows intuitive operations such as:

> _Searching for books, checking availability by branch, checking out and returning books, and creating borrower accounts — all executed through robust SQL interactions behind the scenes._
